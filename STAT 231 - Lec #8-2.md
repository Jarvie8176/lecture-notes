## Recall

* steps of Test of Hypothesis

	* assume null hypothesis H0 will be test using data Y

	* choose test statistic `D(Y)`, let d = D(y) be the observed value of d

	

* interpretation of p-value

## Hypothesis Test for Gaussian Dist with unknown mean and avriance

* define u using chi squared dist

* `P(U <= u) < 0.5`

	* `p value = 2P(U <= u)`

* `P(U <= u) > 0.5`

	* `p value = 2P(U >= u)`
