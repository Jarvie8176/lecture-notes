# Recall - propositional language

* syntax

* value assignment

* tautology

* propositional calculus

* formal forms

	* DNF, CNF



# Normal forms - continued

## How to obtain normal forms

* eliminate impilication

* eliminate and / or

### example

```
¬((p ∨ ¬ q) ∧ ¬ r)
```

* see ```Example 1```

```
(((p ∨ q) ∧ ((r ∨ ¬ p) ∨ s)) ∨ ((¬ p ∧ (r ∨ s)) ∧ ((¬ q ∨ ¬r) ∨ ¬ s)))
```

* see ```Example 2```

## Existence of normal forms

* Theorem

	> **Any formula A in the form of a language is tautologically equivalent to some formula in DNF**
	
* proof


	> if A is contradiction
	
	> then A is tautologically equivalent to the DNF (p ∧ ¬p), where p is any atom in A
	
	> if not, prove by considering an instance of A
	
	
## DNF from truth tables

* drawback

	* need to write down every possible combinations

## CNF and complementation

* Complementation - used to obtain truth value of CNF

## CNF from truth tables

* determines the DNF for ¬f

* let the resulting formula be A

	* see ```Example 3```

# Adequate set of connectives

## unary

| p | ¬p | false | true | p |
|---|----|-------|------|---|
| 0 | 1  | 0     | 1    | 0 |
| 1 | 0  | 0     | 1    | 1 |

## binary

|     |   |   |   |   |
|-----|---|---|---|---|
| p   | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| q   | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| g1  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| g2  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| g3  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| g4  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| g5  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| g6  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| g7  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| g8  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| g9  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| g10 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| g11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| g12 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| g13 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| g14 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| g15 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| g16 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

* see table 1

## Terminology

* adequate - 

* definable - 

* Theorem

	> { neg, and, or} is an adequate set of connective

* Proof

	> use the theorem that states, that any formula is equivalent to a formula in DNF
	>
	> see note 1
	
* nor - ```p ↓ q```

* nand - ```p | q```

## prove adequacy

* prove the set of connectives that is equivalent to {not, end}

## prove inadequacy

* see ```Example 4```

## Boolean algebra

### properties

* Identity laws
* Domination laws
* Assoiciative laws
* commutative laws
* distributive laws

> { and, or, 1, 0, not } satisfies all properties in boolean algebra
> 
> the set of **subsets** of of a universal set U, with the union and intersection operaors, the empty set and the universal set,
