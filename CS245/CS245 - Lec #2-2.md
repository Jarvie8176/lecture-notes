# Tautology / Contradictions

* tautology
	* for all value assignment v,	v(A) = 1

* contingent
   * for some value assignment v,	v(A) = 1

* contradiction
	* for all value assignment v,	v(A) = 0

## Tautology

	```
	Assume A is a tautology
	
	p is a variable in A
	
	replace p with p'
	
	the resulting formula A' is a tautology as well
	```

Example: ```p' = p ^ q```



```A |=| B``` denotes **```“A |= B and B |= A.”```**

* note
	* (tauto)logically implies - statement
	* implies - formula

	* similar for (taoto)logically equivalent

## Truth tables

* prove without using truth table
	* prove by "contradiction"
		* contradiction: logical formula that is always false

Example:

Show that ```{A → B, B → C} |= (A → C)```

```
Suppose {A → B, B → C} |=/ (A → C)

i.e. 

(1) v(A → B) = 1,
(2) v(B → C) = 1,
(3) v(A → C) = 0.

```


Practice (page 28/37)

```
Suppose {

	X ^ Y, Y ^ Z, not Y
	
	|=/
	
	X ^ not Y ^ Z
}

i.e.

(1) v(X ^ Y) = 1,
(2) v(Y ^ Z) = 1,
(3) v(not Y) = 1.
(4) v(X ^ not Y ^ Z) = 0

then

(3) -> (5) v(Y) = 0
(1), (5) -> (6) v(X) = 0
(2), (5) -> (7) v(Z) = 0

(5), (6), (7) -> (4) = 1, contradiction
```

* De Morgan's law

	```¬(p ∧ q)	|=|		(¬p ∨ ¬q) ```
	
	```¬q → ¬p	|=|		p → q```
	
	
# Propositional Calculus

## Simplification 

* use tautology to remove formulas

## Removing cond and bi-cond

* cond: use ```De Morgan```

* bi-cond:
	
	```
	(p → q) ∧ (q → p)
	
	|=|
	
	(¬p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ ¬q)
	
	|=|
	
	(p ∧ q) ∨ (¬p ∧ ¬q)
	```
