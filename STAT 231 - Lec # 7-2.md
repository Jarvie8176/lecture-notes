## Sample size required for given c.i.

* see `Note 1`

## Confidence interval of σ for G(μ,σ) with unknown μ

* see `Note 2`

# Test of Hypothesis

* null hypothesis`h0`

	* "default" hypothesis


* alternative hypothesis

	* can have multiple

* test statistic / discrepancy measure

	* function `D = g(Y)`

		* measures the degree of "agreement" between data `Y` and `h0`
		
		* D is absolute value

	* `D = 0` - best possible agreement
