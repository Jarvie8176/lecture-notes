## Parametric curve

* (`x(t), y(t)`) = Parametric qeuations

* curves also have direction as t increases

	* see `Note 2`

* to skectch a parametric curve

	* `table of values` (i.e. dot ploting)

	* `eliminate t`

	* trick

		* examine `x(t)` and `y(t)` separately

* example

	* see `Note 3`

	* see `Note 4`

	* see `Note 5`

	* see `Note 6`

	* see `Note 7`

		* different equetions can have represent same curve

	* see `Note 8`

		* check domain after eliminating t

	* see `Note 9`



## Tangents and derivatives

* `parametric rule for differentiation`:

	* given parametric equation, may be able to eliminate t and write y as a function of x. it can only be done if the `curve represents a function` (i.e. passes the vertical line test)

	* if not, consider small intervals where the it is a function and write `y = F(x)`
	
	* to find the derivative, use `chain rule`

	* see `Note 10`
