## Linker pseduo code

```
concatenate the program
construct ESD
use ESR
relocate internally
```

* Step 1 - see ```note 1```

* Step 2

	* combine each ESD into a global ESD

	* address/locations have changesd

		* for every program but not the first

	* add the length of all previous programs
		
		* i.e. acc the size of previous programs
	
		* to locations in the new ESD

	* multiple ```.exports``` => error

* Step 3

	* for each ESR entry

		* add the appropriate ```offset``` to the location

			* ```offset``` - length of previous programs

		* check ESD for ```<label>```

			* alter the code appropriately

				* ```.word```

					* just fill in

				* ```beq / bne```

					* calculate offset

					* modify last 16 bits

		* if not in the ESD

			* ad a new ESR with appropriate offset / location

* Step 4

	* for each relocation entry

		* add the **previous program length** to ```<location>```

			* write out new REL note

		* add the **previous program length** to actual code

			* calculate the offset?
