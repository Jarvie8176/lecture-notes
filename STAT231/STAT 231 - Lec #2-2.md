STAT 231 - Lec #4

## Statistical Models

* univariate / bivariate dataset
* describes
	* the selection of units from a population or process
	* the measurement of variates

* usages
	* to model the changes in variate values
	* quantifies the uncertainty
	* formulates the questions in terms of parameters
	* formulates procedures in terms of parameters
	* characterize and/or simulates processes


## Response / Explanatory Variates

* explanatory variate:
	* explains the variate of the variate being studied

* response variate:
	* the variate being studied

## Data Analysis and Statistical Inference

* Descriptive Statistics
	* use data to find patterns and relations
* Statistical Inference
	* inductive reasoning
		* reason from a smaller set to the genera/larger set
	* deductive reasoning


## Statistiacal Problems

### Estimation
* estimating attributs of a process / population

### Hypothesis Testing
* assessing the truth of a question / hypothesis

### Predications
* predict the future value of a variate for **selected** unit


## Statistical Analysis

# Statistical Models and Probablity Distributions

* use random variable to represent a characteristics of variate or process

## Families of Probability Distributions

* "families"
	* describe certain tpypes of situations

* Binominal distribution - model for distribution of (total) outcomes in repeated independent trails with 2 outcomes on each trail

```f(y; theta) = P(Y = y; theta)```

## Estimation of Unknown Parameter

```^theta```: value for theta obtained from the data
