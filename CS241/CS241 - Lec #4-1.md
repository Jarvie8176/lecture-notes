# Loader

```
loop

	decide which program to run
	figure out length (n) of program
	find n words of storage at addr α
	read program into memory at α
	set up program
	put α into register
	jalr $19
	
endloop
```

## MERL Format

* header cookie

	* 1 word

	* ```beq $0, $0, 2```

* length of entire .merl file

	* 1 word

	* total # of bytes

* length of (header + MIPS program)

	* 1 word

* program code

* notes of what to change
	
	* relocations
	* ESR
	* ESD

	```
	ESD:
	
	0x0000 0005
	location of definition
	n - letters of label name
	
	ESR:
	0x11
	location of reference
	n - letters of label name
	```

## MERL Assembler

* Pass 1

	* program now starts 0x0c
	
		* 0x0 - MERL Cookie
		* 0x4 - total length of MERL
		* 0x8 - total length of program + header

* Pass 2

	* write out haeder
	* write out relocation table
	* 
	
## Pseudo code for loader relocation

```
read header
α = findFreeRam(codeLength)
for each instruction				; copy into RAM
	MEM [α + i] = instruction
	
for each relocation entry
	MEM [ α + location] += α
	
place α into $randomshit
jalr $randomshit
```

# Linker

* ESR - External Symbol Reference

* ESD - External Symbol Definition

```.import``` and ```.export``` dir

## Pass 1 / Pass 2 Modification

* Pass 1:

	* keep track of exported symbols

	* keep track of imported labels

* Pass 2:

	* if symbol is not in symbol table, 

	impot
