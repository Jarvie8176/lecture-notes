## Formal Deduction for Predicate Calculus

### additional rules

* `∀-`
	
	`if Σ ⊢ ∀x, A(x), then Σ ⊢ A(t), t is any term`

* `∀+`

	`if Σ ⊢ A(u), u does not occur in Σ, then Σ ⊢ ∀x, A(x)`

	* any member α of a set has a certain property

	* every member of the set has this property

* `∃-`

	```
	if {
		Σ, A(u) ⊢ B,
		u does not occur in Σ or B
	}
	then {
		
	}
	```

* `∃+`	

* `≈-`

* `≈+`

* example

	* `¬∀x, A(x) ⊢ ∃x, ¬A(x)`

		* see `Note 1`

	* `∃x, ¬A(x) ⊢ ¬∀x, A(x)`

		* see `Note 3`

### Soundness and Completeness

	* `∀-` - See `Note 4`
	
	* `∀+` - See `Note 5`

	* `∃+` - See `Note 6`

	* `∃-` - See `Note 7`
