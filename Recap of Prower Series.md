MATH 138 Lec #12-1

# Recap

## Power series

* Given ***series***, find radius and interval of convergence

	* Ratio tes tfor radios

	* Check endpoints of interval without ratio/root test

* Given series, Find sum

	* Relate to known series

	* integrate / differentiate

		* e<sup>x</sup>
		
		* sin(x)

		* cos(x)

		* (1+x)<sup>k</sup>

		* 1/(1-x)

* Given ***function***, find (Taylor) series

	* manipulate known series

		* get radius and endpoints for free

	* integrate / differentiate known series

		* radius for free, need to check endpoints

	* use formula

		* see `Note 3`

		* need to find radius and to check endpoints

	* if asked for a Taylor series around non-standard points

		* try (x - center) + center

* items related to series

	* Find sums

	* Integrals

	* Limits

## Taylor Polynomials

* kth degree taylor poly at x = a for f(x)

	* see `Note 4`

* Taylor's Inequality
